I wrote methods to calculate a shape's perimeter and information about shapes in addition to processing multiple shapes by examining numerous files representing shapes. Wrote methods to find the largest perimeter over several shapes by creating a DirectoryResource (to select multiple files) and then iterating over all these files.
